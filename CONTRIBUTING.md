# Contribute to the WebberZone Code Snippet Library

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets to help modify the default behaviour of the various plugins developed by [WebberZone](https://github.com/WebberZone/).

## Submitting a Snippet

To submit a code-snippet for inclusion in the library, please fork this repository and then submit a pull request.

Guidelines for submission:

- Each snippet should be placed in it's own file
- Each file should be named appropriately based on the purpose of the snippet
- Files should be placed in the appropriate category (folder). If no category exists, you may create one with your pull request.
- All functions and classes should be prefixed with your own unique prefix and the prefix of the corresponding plugin. For example: `ad_crp_{function name here}` for a plugin written by me for [Contextual Related Posts](https://github.com/WebberZone/contextual-related-posts).
- Although not mandatory, it is recommended to set up each snippet as it's own plugin that a user can upload and activate
